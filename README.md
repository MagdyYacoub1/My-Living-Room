# My-Living-Room
3D OpenGl project that shows a complete 3D room with a TV inside. The TV, by a click of a button, can show the entire room.

before cloning this project, please make sure that you have openGl installed on your machine.
I found this link very usful for installing openGl: https://www.absingh.com/opengl/

After cloning the repositry run the project.
You can controll the camera using W,A,S,D keys and the mouse.
To controll the TV press C.
To exit the TV mode press C again.

Credit for the project idea and part of the implementation returns to my teammate Cronoslave.
